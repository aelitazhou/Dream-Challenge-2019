# Dream-Challenge
Malaria DREAM Challenge 2019

We have in total 30 isolates and each isolate can have different number of the replicates. To make the data more standard, we first subtract the non-drug replicate from the corresponding replicate that has been given the drug DHA. Note that we have two time point and we intend to make the whole process more continuous, thus we then put the 24-hour data after the corresponding 6-hour data. Now we have divided the row number of the replicates of every isolate by four and the data seems more reasonable. Choose the gene expression data as the features and the DHA_IC50 as the label, we then form a regression machine learning problem. Last step to curate the data would be to standardize the features and centralize the label. The dimension of the features is way more than that of the isolate. Therefore, we decided to reduce the dimension of the features first using the kpca method. Because of the limited isolates, we chose shallow model instead of the deep model. After trying several of the shallow models, such as lasso, svm etc. We chose ridge to do the regression. And we use the mean squared error as the scoring function to do the hyper-parameter tuning. After choosing the most proper combination of the hyper-parameter, we can then train the model and predict the result of the test data as the usual machine learning problem.
